# web3-toolkit

A collection of projects to help with building web3 dapps and libraries.

## Development

Install all the recommended VScode extensions. You can view and install the recommended extensions
from the VScode Extensions tab and searching for `@recommended`.
The Vue official extension seems to be broken after a certain version, for now set it to `2.0.10`.

This project uses [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) for management.

Environment variables are managed with `dotenvx`. Learn more about setting up and encrypting
environment variables in the [personal docs](./docs/dotenvx).
