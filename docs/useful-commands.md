# Useful Commands

Collection of commands to help with development, debugging, etc.

## Creating new projects

Currently just using the `npm create vite@latest` where I can when setting up new projects in the
/packages and /playground directories.

## ESLint

The `@eslint/config-inspector` is really helpful in visualizing the eslint configuration.

```sh
pnpx @eslint/config-inspector@latest
```

## Bundle visualizer

[vite-bundle-visualizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-bundle-visualizer)

To help visualize the bundles made by Vite, use `vite-bundle-visualizer`.

```sh
pnpx vite-bundle-visualizer
```
